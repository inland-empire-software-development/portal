**Components that require updating:**
- New component name 

**Tech to be used:**  
- UIKit
- HTML/SASS
- Fontawesome Pro

**What is the current behavior:**
We currently don't have a User information input panel component.

**Description:**
Create a proof of concept using HTML/CSS. Take the design PDF and convert it to code. You will be using UIKit as the CSS library along with Fontawesome PRO icons. Any comments you need to make, make them in the discussion of the issue or the implementation issue for this component. 

The expected deliverable will be a component that is responsive and mobile ready. Preferably an HTML file. No comments. No inline CSS. No JavaScript unless otherwise informed. Next task will deal with converting this to a component in React.

**Justification:** Vital component
